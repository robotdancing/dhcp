Tests are dividing on error vs working, and DHCPv4 vs DHCPv6.

Names of files about test xyz have xyz as body and an extension.

Extensions:
 - .err4 = source for error test in DHCPv4
 - .errF = source for error test in DHCPv4 with -r fatal
 - .errP = source for error test in DHCPv4 with -r pass
 - .err6 = source for error test in DHCPv6
 - .err  = source for error test in DHCPv4 and DHCPv6
 - .msg  = resultat (first line of standard error) for error test
 - .in4  = source for working test in DHCPv4
 - .in6  = source for working test in DHCPv6
 - .out  = resultat for working test
There is no working test in DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.
The body of the name of a working test must include 4 or 6 so
the .out can be submitted to kea-dhcp4 or kea-dhcp6

runone.sh xyz.ext
 -> run the xyz test
runall.sh
 -> run all tests
